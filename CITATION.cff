    description: DQM Global Template Generate Repo
repository-code: 'https://github.com/MijaToka/DQM_TCWafers'
abstract: >-
  This repository handles the creation of TC wafer templates for the HGCal DQM.

  The TC are made via a jupyter notebook generateTCwafer.ipynb where the TC's 
  are defined as rombuses in the sequence given by the WaferCellMapTraces.txt file. 
  9The ordering of these cells was chosen by visual inspection thanks to the 
  generateTCvisualization.ipynb which holds the scripts to read this input file and 
  process it to display the module so that the value of the cell corresponds to the
  value of the "Global TC count", ie the index asigned to the TC by the Cell indexer.
  This file also contains python sketches of the Cell and Module indexer for the TC
  and an ESProducer sketch that later was included into CMSSW.
